Spring Security - User Registration Form with Custom Database Tables

Question:

I want to add registration module into spring security login demo application. How should I do this? I want to access registration page from Login page through hyperlink and after submit data into database.

Answer

I have a document that covers this. It performs user registration with custom user details with Spring Security using Hibernate. Custom user details include: user name, password, first name, last name and email. You can feel free to extend it with additional custom fields. Demo includes Hibernate, database support, encrypted passwords. The code uses Maven, all Java config (no xml) Hibernate configuration

Spring Security  and Thymeleaf

Question:

How would we convert spring-security-user-registration-custom-user-code to use Thymeleaf instead of JSP?

Answer

Here is the source code for this:

- Non-Spring Boot version: bonus-code-spring-security-user-registration-custom-user-details-thymeleaf.zip

- Spring Boot version: bonus-code-spring-security-user-registration-custom-user-details-thymeleaf-spring-boot.zip


Here are some rough notes on the Thymeleaf version:

- For docs on Spring MVC and Thymeleaf integration, see this link

- For docs on Spring Security and Thymeleaf integration, see this link

A couple of high-level changes

1. Add the Thymeleaf pom entries

    <!-- Thymeleaf core support -->
    <dependency>
    	<groupId>org.thymeleaf</groupId>
    	<artifactId>thymeleaf-spring5</artifactId>
    	<version>3.0.11.RELEASE</version>
    </dependency>
     
    <!-- Thymeleaf security support -->
    <dependency>
    	<groupId>org.thymeleaf.extras</groupId>
    	<artifactId>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5</artifactId>
    	<version>3.0.4.RELEASE</version>
    </dependency>


2. Configure Thymeleaf engine and resolvers.

See code example in: DemoAppConfig.java


3. Create Thymeleaf views

See code examples in: webapp/WEB-INF/views

Answer

I have a solution that covers this scenario. This includes PDF description and source code.
